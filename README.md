## ðŸ–– Wave Portal [UI]
The project is deployed in Vercel so that you can see it and interact with it, any criticism or comment is appreciated, you can access the demo at the following link:

### **[DEMO](https://sampi-wave-portal-ui.vercel.app/)**

This project consumes a smart contract developed in Solidity using the HardHat framework, you can find the repository at the following link:
### [REPO SMART-CONTRACT](https://github.com/Sampisatrn/My-Wave-Portal-SC)

## About Project
Web project based on web3 developed with **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** and **[ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/)**. In this application, users will be able to leave a message that will be stored within the chain of blocks, for this it is necessary to first authenticate using the **[Metamask](https://metamask.io/)** wallet and configure it to use the **[Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/#stats)** testnet. Users will be able to leave a message through a modal that will be stored in the block chain, for this it is necessary to pay for the transactions using ETH.

Since we are in the Goerli network we will not be using real ETH, but test ones. To add balance to your wallet and thus have ETH to use in the Goerli network, you can use the following **[link](https://goerlifaucet.com/)** When a user leaves a message they have a ***50 % probability of winning a reward in ETH*** that will be automatically deposited in your wallet. The platform will notify you if you have won the reward.

This was a 100% academic project while I was doing the **[buildspace](https://buildspace.so/)** platform courses, which I recommend to all developers who want to start developing for web3. You can test the application by entering the following link: **[Wave Portal ðŸ”»](https://sampi-wave-portal-ui.vercel.app/)** The application is connected to a smart contract developed with the technology **[Solidity](https://solidity-es.readthedocs.io/es/latest/#)**, you can check their repo **[here](https://github.com/Sampisatrn/My-Wave-Portal-SC)**

### This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)

## Getting Started
First, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file. [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`. The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More
To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:
- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.
You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel
The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details
